This simple physics engine demonstrates simple rigid body dynamics
on axis-aligned circles, boxes and planes.

It supports the following features:
 - Integration with fixed time-step.
 - Collision detection between circles, AABBs and planes.
 - Collision de-penetration.
 - Collision resolution using impulse.
 - Friction using impulse.

I started implementing rotation but I ran out of time before I could
get it to work with any sort of stability, but this is something that
I'd like to add in the future and that the physics engine could benefit
a lot from. Joints and springs would be cool features to add as well

This physics implementation uses the Finn Morgan's Simple
Framework to manage rendering and mouse input.
